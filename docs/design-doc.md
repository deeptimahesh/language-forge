# Language Forge: Design Document

## 1. Project Overview

**Language Forge** is an interactive application that guides users through creating
constructed languages (conlangs) from scratch. The system walks users through a
systematic language creation process while allowing customization at each step,
enabling the creation of rich, culturally-contextualized fictional languages.

## 2. Core Workflow

The application follows a progressive language construction workflow:

### 1. Phonology Foundation

- Sound inventory selection (consonants, vowels)
- Phonotactic rules (allowed sound combinations)
- Stress and intonation patterns
- Optional: Sound changes over time

### 2. Lexicon Generation

- Root word creation based on phonological rules
- Semantic field assignment
- Cultural context integration for core vocabulary
- Etymology system

### 3. Morphological Rules

- Word formation processes (affixation, compounding)
- Grammatical categories (tense, aspect, number, gender, etc.)
- Declension and conjugation systems
- Irregularity patterns

### 4. Syntax Generation

- Word order rules
- Phrase structure
- Agreement patterns
- Complex sentence formation

### 5. Cultural Context Integration

- Historical development
- Social registers and dialects
- Idioms and figurative language
- Cultural artifacts in language (taboos, honorifics)

### 6. Orthography (optional)

- Writing system design
- Character/symbol development

## 3. User Experience

### User Interface Design

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Interface reveals complexity gradually
- **Wizard-Based Flow**: Step-by-step guidance with ability to revisit previous steps
- **Dashboard**: Central hub showing language components and progress
- **Visualization Tools**: Sound charts, grammar tables, writing system displays

### User Interaction Patterns

- **Guided Creation**: AI suggests options based on user inputs
- **Free Customization**: Override AI suggestions at any point
- **Natural Language Inputs**: Users describe what they want ("a language for
forest-dwelling elves with a melodic quality")
- **Contextual Help**: Linguistic concepts explained as encountered

## 4. AI Architecture

### LangChain Integration

- **Agent Framework**: Coordinating specialized language creation agents
- **Chain-of-Thought Processing**: Breaking down user inputs into linguistic requirements
- **Memory System**: Maintaining consistency across language components
- **Tool Integration**: Specialized linguistic analysis and generation tools

### AI Modules

#### Language Profile Agent

- Interprets user description
- Maps attributes to linguistic features
- Maintains overall language coherence

#### Phonology Agent

- Sound inventory generation
- Phonotactic rule formulation
- Cultural/species physiological constraints

#### Lexicon Agent

- Root word generation
- Semantic field mapping
- Cultural context application

#### Grammar Agent

- Morphological system design
- Syntactic rule formulation
- Typological consistency checking

#### Cultural Context Agent

- Historical development simulation
- Sociolinguistic feature integration
- Idiom and metaphor generation

## 5. Technical Considerations

### Data Models

- **Language Profile**: Core parameters and design goals
- **Phonology Model**: Sound inventory and rules
- **Lexicon Database**: Word roots and derivations
- **Grammar Rule System**: Morphological and syntactic rules
- **Cultural Context Layer**: Sociolinguistic mappings

### State Management

- **Progressive Building**: Each step builds on previous
- **Consistency Checking**: Cross-referencing between language components
- **Versioning**: Allowing exploration of alternatives
- **Export Capability**: Documentation generation

### Advanced Features (Future)

- **Language Evolution Simulation**: Historical linguistics tools
- **Translation Interface**: Convert between created language and English
- **Community Sharing**: Exchange and collaborate on languages
- **Audio Generation**: Pronunciation samples

## 6. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Framework

- Language profile system
- Basic phonology generation
- Simple AI agent architecture

### Phase 2: Feature Expansion

- Complete lexicon generation
- Comprehensive morphology tools
- Enhanced UI with visualization

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

- Full syntax generation
- Cultural context integration
- Documentation generation

### Phase 4: Refinement & Polish

- Performance optimization
- Advanced AI capabilities
- User testing and refinement

## 7. Technical Stack Considerations

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React with Next.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Visualization**: D3.js for linguistic charts

### Backend

- **API Layer**: Node.js with Express or Next.js API routes
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible schema
- **Authentication**: OAuth for user accounts

### AI Integration

- **LangChain**: For agent orchestration
- **LLM Integration**: GPT-4 or equivalent for natural language understanding
- **Vector Database**: For semantic mapping of language components
