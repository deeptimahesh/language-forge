# Language Forge: AI Phonology Consultant

## Overview

The AI Phonology Consultant is an interactive feature that helps users create appropriate phoneme inventories for their constructed languages through natural conversation. Rather than requiring linguistic expertise, users can express their goals and preferences conversationally, and the AI will recommend phonemes and patterns based on their needs.

## User Experience

### Interface Components

1. **Chat Window**
   - A compact chat interface positioned at the bottom of the phonology page
   - Toggleable/collapsible to preserve screen space
   - Shows conversation history and input field

2. **AI Actions**
   - As conversation progresses, the AI will highlight and select phonemes in the existing phoneme selector component
   - Visual indicators will show AI-recommended phonemes vs. user selections

### Conversation Flow

1. **Initiation**
   - Users can open the AI consultant via a button labeled "Get AI Recommendations"
   - Initial prompt welcomes user and asks about their language goals

2. **Discovery Questions**
   - AI asks targeted questions to understand user's vision
   - Mix of open-ended questions and specific choices

3. **Interactive Recommendations**
   - AI makes selections in real-time as conversation progresses
   - User can accept, reject, or modify recommendations

4. **Refinement**
   - User can ask follow-up questions or request changes
   - AI explains linguistic concepts relevant to selections

## Technical Implementation

### Components

1. **ChatUI Component**

   ```
   src/components/language/phonology/PhonologyAIChat.tsx
   ```

   - Manages chat display, history, and user input
   - Handles animation, scrolling, and UI state

2. **AI Service**

   ```
   src/services/phonologyAI.ts
   ```

   - Processes user inputs
   - Manages conversation state and context
   - Contains language knowledge and recommendation logic

3. **Integration with PhonemeSelector**

   ```
   src/components/language/phonology/AIPhonemeSelector.tsx
   ```

   - Extends existing PhonemeSelector with AI capabilities
   - Provides methods for AI to select/highlight phonemes

### Data Models

1. **Conversation State**

   ```typescript
   interface ConversationState {
     messages: Message[];
     languagePreferences: LanguagePreferences;
     stage: 'introduction' | 'discovery' | 'recommendation' | 'refinement';
     recommendedPhonemes: Set<string>;
   }
   ```

2. **Language Preferences**

   ```typescript
   interface LanguagePreferences {
     inspirations: string[];
     soundCharacteristics: SoundCharacteristic[];
     complexity: 'simple' | 'moderate' | 'complex';
     speakerFamiliarity: 'english' | 'other' | 'none';
     purpose: string;
     culturalContext?: string;
   }
   ```

## Conversation Topics

### 1. Language Inspiration

- "What existing languages inspire your constructed language?"
- "Is there a particular language family you'd like to draw from?"
- "Should your language sound similar to any real-world languages?"

### 2. Sound Characteristics

- "How would you describe the sound of your ideal language?"
  - Options: melodic, harsh, breathy, guttural, smooth, etc.
- "Should your language have any distinctive sound patterns?"
- "Are there sounds you definitely want to include or exclude?"

### 3. Complexity

- "How phonologically complex should your language be?"
- "Would you prefer many distinct sounds or a smaller inventory?"
- "Are you comfortable with sounds that might be challenging for English speakers?"

### 4. Purpose & Context

- "What's the purpose of this language? (storytelling, game, personal project)"
- "Is this language for a particular type of fictional culture or species?"
- "Are there environmental factors that might influence how the language sounds?"

## Phoneme Selection Logic

### Language Family Templates

- **Germanic-inspired:** Focus on /p, t, k, b, d, g, f, v, s, z, ʃ, h, m, n, l, r, j, w/ with front rounded vowels
- **Romance-inspired:** Include palatals, fewer fricatives, clear vowel system
- **Slavic-inspired:** Rich in sibilants, palatalization, complex consonant clusters
- **Arabic/Semitic-inspired:** Include pharyngeals, emphatics, three-vowel system
- **East Asian-inspired:** May include tones, simpler syllable structure

### Sound Characteristic Mappings

- **Melodic:** More sonorants (nasals, liquids), balanced vowels, fewer obstruents
- **Harsh:** More stops, affricates, stridents, consonant clusters
- **Breathy:** Include /h, ɦ/, aspirated stops, breathier vowels
- **Smooth:** Limit consonant clusters, favor continuants, avoid stridents
- **Alien/Exotic:** Incorporate rare sounds like clicks, ejectives, or unusual contrastive features

### Complexity Scaling

- **Simple:** 15-20 phonemes, common sounds, simple syllable structure
- **Moderate:** 20-30 phonemes, some less common sounds, moderate complexity
- **Complex:** 30+ phonemes, potentially including rare sounds or contrasts

## Example Dialogs

### Example 1: Fantasy Language

```
User: I need help creating a language for forest elves in my fantasy novel

AI: That sounds interesting! For a forest elf language, we might want something that sounds elegant and natural. 
    Would you like it to sound melodic and flowing, or more mysterious and otherworldly?

User: More melodic and flowing, like the wind through trees

AI: Perfect! For a melodic forest language, I'd recommend these sounds:
    [AI selects certain vowels and consonants]
    
    I've selected sounds that work well in flowing sequences - plenty of vowels, some soft consonants like 'l', 'm', 'n', and 's'.
    Would you like to add some distinctive sounds that might give it a more magical or elvish quality?

User: Yes, something distinctive but still beautiful

AI: In that case, I'll add some palatalized consonants and front vowels that give an ethereal quality.
    [AI selects additional phonemes]
    
    These sounds are found in languages often described as "musical" like Finnish or Elvish in Tolkien's works.
    How complex should the sound system be overall?
```

### Example 2: Alien Language

```
User: I want to create an alien language that sounds nothing like human languages

AI: An alien language that's truly non-human! That's a fun challenge.
    Human languages all share certain patterns because of our vocal anatomy. 
    For a truly alien feel, we could break these patterns.
    
    Would you prefer sounds that humans could still pronounce, or are you open to more theoretical sounds?

User: Humans should be able to pronounce it, but it should sound very strange

AI: Great! Let's create something pronounceable but unusual.
    [AI selects unusual combinations of phonemes]
    
    I've selected some sounds that rarely appear together in human languages.
    This includes some clicks, ejectives, and unusual consonant combinations.
    
    Would you like to add any distinctive sound patterns, like using tones or unusual syllable structures?
```
