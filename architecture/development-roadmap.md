## 7. Technical Priorities

### 7.1 Critical Path Components

1. **Authentication & User Management**
   - Essential for user data persistence
   - Dependency for all personalized features

2. **AI Agent Architecture**
   - Core to language generation functionality
   - Needs early implementation for iterative improvement

3. **Data Persistence Layer**
   - Foundational for saving language components
   - Must be robust and scalable from the start

4. **Interactive UI Components**
   - Critical for user engagement
   - Required for effective language visualization

### 7.2 Technical Debt Prevention

- Regular code reviews and refactoring sessions
- Comprehensive test coverage (aim for 80%+)
- Documentation as development occurs
- Performance monitoring from early stages
- Regular security audits

## 8. Release Strategy

### 8.1 Alpha Release (End of Phase 1)

- Limited user group (20-30 users)
- Focus on core phonology and basic lexicon
- Collect feedback on fundamental UX
- Primary goal: validate core concept

### 8.2 Beta Release (End of Phase 2)

- Expanded user group (100-200 users)
- Include grammar and expanded lexicon features
- Structured feedback collection
- Primary goal: feature validation and bug hunting

### 8.3 Public Launch (End of Phase 4)

- Open access
- Full feature set
- Marketing push
- Primary goal: user acquisition and engagement

## 9. Risk Management

### 9.1 Technical Risks

- **AI Integration Complexity**
  - Mitigation: Start with simplified prompts, iteratively improve
  - Fallback: Provide more structured input options if generation quality varies

- **Performance with Large Languages**
  - Mitigation: Implement pagination and lazy loading
  - Fallback: Set reasonable limits for free tier users

- **Database Scalability**
  - Mitigation: Design with sharding in mind from the start
  - Fallback: Implement aggressive caching

### 9.2 Product Risks

- **User Learning Curve**
  - Mitigation: Progressive disclosure UI, extensive tooltips
  - Fallback: Guided creation wizards

- **Linguistic Accuracy**
  - Mitigation: Consult with linguistics experts during development
  - Fallback: Clear documentation of simplifications

- **User Retention**
  - Mitigation: Engagement features, regular content
  - Fallback: Email re-engagement campaigns
